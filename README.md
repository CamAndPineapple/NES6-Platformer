# NES6-Platformer
------------------
Growing up, I loved playing my NES. It was my first gaming system, and has embedded a ton of nostalgia within me.

This project is my attempt to make a NES style platformer using ES6 syntax.

NES + ES6 = NES6

I'm hoping to write a rudimentary build system as I develop this game in order to get more familiar with ES6 features, and improve my javascript fundamentals and code organization.
