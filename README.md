# NES6-Platformer
------------------
I'll never forget that magical feeling of playing my NES as a kid. It was my first gaming system, and has fostered a ton of nostalgia within me.

This project is my attempt to make a basic NES-style platformer using ES6 syntax. 

NES + ES6 = NES6

I'm hoping to write a rudimentary game engine as I develop this game in order to get more familiar with ES6 features, and improve my javascript fundamentals and code organization.
